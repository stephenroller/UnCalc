# UnCalc

UnCalc is a Unit Calculator, much like
[Google Calculator](http://www.google.com/intl/en/help/features.html#calculator).
It is written in Python.

## Usage

    $ python calculator.py '10 miles per hour in m / s'
    4.470 m/s

## Current Limitations

UnCalc 

  * UnCalc has a very limited list of supported units. See units.py for a 
    complete list.
  * UnCalc does not know about any constants, like pi, e and hbar.
  * UnCalc cannot handle compound units, such as Newtons or mph.

## Dependencies

UnCalc depends on [ply](http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/).
